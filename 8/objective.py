# Define the variables for your pricing problem
# For example, let p be a vector of prices for each ad, and x be a vector of impressions for each ad
n = 10 # number of ads
p = cp.Variable(n) # prices
x = cp.Variable(n) # impressions

# Define the parameters for your pricing problem
# For example, let c be a vector of costs for each ad, and d be a vector of demand functions for each ad
c = np.random.rand(n) # costs
d = np.random.rand(n) # demand functions

# Define your objective function
# For example, let your objective be to maximize the total revenue minus the total cost
objective = cp.Maximize(p @ (d - x) - c @ x)

# Define your constraints
# For example, let your constraints be that the prices and impressions are non-negative, and that the impressions are less than or equal to the demand

# Create a problem object with your objective and constraints

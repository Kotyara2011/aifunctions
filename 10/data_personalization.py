# Load the segmented user data from the CSV file
user_df = pd.read_csv("user_data_segmented.csv")

# Create user personas for each segment based on the descriptive statistics of the user data
user_df.groupby("segment").describe()

# For example, based on the output of the above command, we can create the following user personas:

# Segment 0: Young and active users who frequently visit the website and have high conversion rates. They prefer simple and direct surveys and are interested in the product features and benefits. They are likely to be influenced by social media and word-of-mouth.
# Segment 1: Older and loyal users who have been using the website for a long time and have moderate conversion rates. They prefer detailed and informative surveys and are interested in the product quality and reliability. They are likely to be influenced by reviews and ratings.
# Segment 2: New and curious users who have recently joined the website and have low conversion rates. They prefer interactive and engaging surveys and are interested in the product novelty and variety. They are likely to be influenced by promotions and discounts.

# Generate tailored content or recommendations for each user segment based on their preferences and interests
# For example, based on the user personas, we can generate the following content or recommendations:

# Segment 0: Show them a catchy headline that highlights the main feature or benefit of the product, such as "How to boost your productivity with this amazing tool". Provide them with a short and simple survey that asks them about their goals and challenges, such as "What is your biggest obstacle to achieving your goals?". Recommend them products that match their needs and preferences, such as "Based on your answers, we think you will love this product that helps you overcome your obstacle".
# Segment 1: Show them a trustworthy headline that emphasizes the quality or reliability of the product, such as "Why this product is rated as the best in its category". Provide them with a detailed and informative survey that asks them about their experience and satisfaction, such as "How long have you been using our website?". Recommend them products that have high ratings and reviews, such as "Based on your feedback, we think you will appreciate this product that has a 4.9 star rating and over 1000 positive reviews".
# Segment 2: Show them a creative headline that showcases the novelty or variety of the product, such as "Discover the new and exciting features of this product". Provide them with an interactive and engaging survey that asks them about their curiosity and preferences, such as "What kind of products are you looking for?". Recommend them products that have special offers or discounts, such as "Based on your choices, we think you will enjoy this product that has a 50% off deal for a limited time".

# Test the effectiveness of the personalization using metrics such as conversion rate, retention rate, or customer lifetime value
# For example, to test the conversion rate, we can use a logistic regression model to predict whether a user will buy a product or not based on their segment and other features

# Define the features (X) and the target (y)
X = user_df.drop(["segment", "bought"], axis=1)
y = user_df["bought"]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a logistic regression object
logreg = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the logistic regression object to the training data
logreg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the target for the testing data
y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy score and the roc_auc_score for the testing data
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the scores
print(f"The accuracy score is {accuracy:.2f}.")
print(f"The roc_auc_score is {roc_auc:.2f}.")

# Plot the confusion matrix for the testing data
sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt="d")
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.ylabel("Actual")
plt.show()
